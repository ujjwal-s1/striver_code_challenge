You are given an array of size ‘N’. The elements of the array are in the range from 1 to ‘N’.
Ideally, the array should contain elements from 1 to ‘N’. But due to some miscalculations, 
there is a number R in the range [1, N] which appears in the array twice and another number M in the range [1, N] which is missing from the array.
Your task is to find the missing number (M) and the repeating number (R).


# Equation Method
def missingAndRepeating(arr, n):
    S = n*(n+1)//2
    P = n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)//6
    for i in arr:
        S -= i
        P -= i*i
    missing = (S + P/S)//2
    repeat = missing - S
    return int(missing), int(repeat)
    
    
# XOR Method
